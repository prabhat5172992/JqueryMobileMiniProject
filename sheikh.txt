The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is a mammoth modern mosque of incredible beauty.
 Harnessing contemporary design and ancient craftsmanship skills, the mosque is a harmonious blend of modern and old. 
It doesn't fail to dazzle all who enter with its lavish use of gold, mosaic work and glass work,
 marble in gigantic proportions and blindingly white stone contrasting dramatically under the Emirati blue sky.
