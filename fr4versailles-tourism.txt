One of the best known tourist attractions in France, few places better showcase the opulence and grandeur of the French monarchy better than the Palace of Versailles. 
There's a huge amount to see here, from stunning architecture to fabulous furniture, art and antiques and of course the magnificent gardens. 
Audio headsets are available as are guided tours, probably a good idea given the sheer scale of the place.
