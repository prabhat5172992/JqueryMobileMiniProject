Located in Western Australia, Purnululu National Park is home to one of Australia's most unique tourist attractions known as the Bungle Bungle Range,
striking orange-and-black-striped sandstone domes that resemble huge beehives. 
Surprisingly, the site was known only to local Aboriginal Australians and farmers until recently.
In fact, it only became famous after a documentary was made of the area in 1983. The park is also home to Cathedral Gorge, an amazing natural amphitheater. 
Because Purnululu National Park is located in a fairly remote area, visitors to its two campsites must pack in and out all of their essential supplies.
