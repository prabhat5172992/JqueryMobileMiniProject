The commemorative poppies powered the Tower of London into the eighth spot with visitors up 6% in 2014 to just over 3 million. 
Between Aug. 5 and Nov. 11, 2014 the Tower of London was filled with 888,246 ceramic poppies to coincide with the centenary of World War I.
Created by artists Paul Cummins and Tom Piper, the poppies, once removed, were sold to raise money for charity.
