The Burj Khalifa may give you that famous skyline view from up high, 
but the most iconic Dubai views are still taken from the water. 
Dubai Creek slices through the city and the best way to experience Dubai is from one of the beautiful dhows (traditional Arabic boats) that ply the creek. 
Sunset cruises are particularly beautiful as you watch the lights of the high-rises begin to twinkle in the dusk.
