The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the strait between San Francisco and Marin County to the north. 
The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when it was completed in 1937, 
and has become an internationally recognized symbol of San Francisco and California. 
The famous red-orange color of the bridge was specifically chosen to make the bridge more easily visible through the thick fog that frequently shrouds the bridge.
