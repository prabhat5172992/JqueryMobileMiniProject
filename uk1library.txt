The Library of Birmingham is the only attraction outside of London to break the top ten. 
Some 2.4 million people visited the building, which opened in September 2013. Designed by architect Francine Houben,
the building holds current and rare books and photos. 
As well a library, the space also houses an art gallery and one of the British Film Institute's Mediatheques, 
which gives free access to the National Film Archive.
