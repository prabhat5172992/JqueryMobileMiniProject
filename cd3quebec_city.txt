Quebec City may be the capital of the Quebec province in eastern Canada, but its French heritage, 
architecture and language make it appear more like a charming European village. 
Perched on a hill overlooking the St. Lawrence River is Vieux Quebec, the city's historic district. 
A walk along the cobblestone streets of the Old City offers encounters with attractions like the Citadel and the Place-Royale, 
the area where explorer, Samuel de Camplain, established the first North American-French settlement. The city's icon, the stunning Chateau Frontenac, 
is regarded as the most photographed hotel in North America and offers tours even without an overnight stay.
