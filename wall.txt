In the eyes of most travelers, you haven't been to China if you haven't climbed the Great Wall.
One of the iconic symbols of China, the Great Wall is the longest wall in the world, an awe-inspiring feat of ancient defensive architecture. 
Its winding path over rugged country and steep mountains takes in some great scenery. 
It deserves its place among "the New Seven Wonders of the World" and the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in China.
The wall spans from China's western frontier to the east coast, totaling around 5,000 km (3,100 miles), 
but the most integrated and best preserved sections are close to Beijing.
So this is what people usually mean when mentioning the Great Wall of China.
