Orchard Road is the main shopping street of Singapore, regularly frequented by the locals as well as foreign tourists. 
Named after the fruit orchards that the road led to, Orchard Road is flanked by malls, numerous upmarket restaurants, coffee chains, cafes, nightclubs and hotels. 
It is also the site of the official residence of the President of Singapore, the Istana.
The Christmas decorations along Orchard are famous and entirely over the top, with reindeers cavorting through palm trees and gingerbread houses topped with fake snow.
