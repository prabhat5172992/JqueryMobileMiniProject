The karst landscape along the Li River has captured the heart of artists. 
Generations of Chinese painters and poets have been inspired by the beauty of nature there,
using their pens and brushes to capture the breath-taking natural scenery.
Nowadays it's a popular photography destination. 
When Chinese travelers seek a place for natural beauty, they first think of Li River and Yangshuo.
The 83-kilometer-long section of the Li River between Guilin and Yangshuo is the most beautiful.
The river landscape is decorated with startling hills, steep cliffs, and farming villages, and is lined with bamboo groves.
The Li River was listed as one of the "World's Top Ten Watery Wonders" by America's National Geographic Magazine.
Several world famous figures have visited the Li River, including former US Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush (senior), and Bill Gates.
