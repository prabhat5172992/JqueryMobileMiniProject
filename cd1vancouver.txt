Situated between the Coast Mountains and the Pacific Ocean in British Columbia, 
Vancouver is favored for its majestic landscapes that present a natural playground where tourists can swim in the ocean, 
rollerblade through scenic parks and snow ski in the mountains all in one day. 
The third largest metropolitan area in the country, Vancouver is one of the most poplar places to visit in Canada. 
Vancouver's star attraction is Stanley Park which covers a huge area of woodlands, gardens and green spaces. 
Some of the city's other top sites include Granville Island's remarkable food market and Chinatown's vibrant array of shops.
