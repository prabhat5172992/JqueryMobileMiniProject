The Colosseum in Rome is the largest and most famous amphitheater in the Roman world. 
Its construction was started by emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty in 72 AD and was finished by his son Titus in 80 AD. 
The Colosseum was capable of holding some 50,000 spectators who could enter the building through no less than 80 entrances. 
Spectators were protected from the rain and heat of the sun by sails called the "velarium" , that was attached around the top of the attic.
