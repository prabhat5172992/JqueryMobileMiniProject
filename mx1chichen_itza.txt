Chichen Itza is the largest of the Maya cities in the Yucatan Peninsula and one of Mexico's most visited tourist destinations. 
The most famous landmark of Chichen Itza is the temple-pyramid of El Castillo. 
The design of the temple has special astronomical significance. 
Each face of the pyramid has a stairway with 91 steps, which together with the shared step at the top, add up to 365, the number of days in a year. 
Other highlights of Chichen Itza include the Great Ballcourt and El Caracol, a circular temple which served as an astronomical observatory.
