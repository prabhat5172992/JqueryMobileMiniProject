One of the top destinations for underwater explorers and scuba divers is the world's largest barrier reef system, 
famously known as the Great Barrier Reef. Located in the Coral Sea, the Great Barrier Reef encompasses a huge area of more than 2,900 coral reefs and hundreds of islands and cays. 
The best way to explore the Reef is by one of the numerous boat cruises that run along the northern coast of Queensland. 
The town of Cairns is regarded as the main gateway to the Reef, but other towns also offer cruise operations.
