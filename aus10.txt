Cable Beach is located in Broome in Western Australia and is considered by some to be this state's most popular destination. 
It is a stunning beach, known for its white sands, beautiful sunsets and the brilliant blue waters of the Indian Ocean. 
Cable Beach is also famous for its camel rides on the beach. 
Those who prefer motorized transportation can choose to cross the sands in a four-wheel-drive vehicle instead.
