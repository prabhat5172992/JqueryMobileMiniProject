The White House in Washington DC is the official residence and office of the President of the United States. 
It was built between 1792 and 1800 and first used by President John Adams. 
After the 9/11 attacks it has become more difficult to visit the White House and today tours are available only for groups of 10 or more 
and must be requested up to six months in advance through your member of Congress or your country's US Ambassador.
