Located in Australia's Northern Territory, about three hours north of Darwin, Kakadu is the country's largest national park. 
There is a lot to see in Kakadu National Park, including a large concentration of Aboriginal rock art; some of which are estimated to be up to 20,000 years old. 
This park is also home to many different species of wildlife, including wallabies, dingoes and crocodiles. 
In addition, Kakadu National Park, which is home to one-third of Australia's bird species, is a birdwatcher's dream.
