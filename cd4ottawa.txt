Located at the confluence of the Ottawa, Gatineau and Rideau rivers in southeastern Ontario, Ottawa is the capital of Canada. 
As the nation's capital, Ottawa is home to many financial, commercial and federal establishments including Parliament Hill, 
the government seat where the ceremonial Changing of the Guard takes place daily during the summer. 
Running right through the heart of the city, the Rideau Canal is Ottawa's star attraction. 
In winter the canal becomes the world's largest ice skating ring.
