One of Brazil's best-preserved colonial cities, Olinda is located on Atlantic Coast in the northeastern state of Pernambuco. 
Perched on a picturesque hilltop surrounded by trees, Olinda's historic downtown is a treasure trove of 
colonial churches, colorful old houses, restaurants, museums and numerous artisan studios. 
Every year, Olinda hosts its lively Carnival celebration that differs somewhat from those of 
Rio de Janeiro and Salvador in that Olinda's festival is best attended at daytime and features the music, dances and traditions of African culture.
