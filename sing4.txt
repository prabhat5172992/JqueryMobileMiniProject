If construction costs are a traveler's bag, then they'll delight in seeing the Marina Bay Sands, a resort that cost US$5.7 billion to build, 
making it the world's most expensive building when it opened in 2010. The Marina Bay Sands is an integrated resort that has it all: a luxury hotel, 
restaurants, an endless collection of shops, a convention center that is one of the largest in Asia, theater, an ArtScience Museum and other entertainment centers. 
It also has an indoor skating rink made with synthetic ice.
