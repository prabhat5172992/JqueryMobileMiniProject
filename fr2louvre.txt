One of the best known major visitor attractions in France, the Louvre contains world-famous art, sculpture and artefacts from periods spanning over 2,000 years of history. 
Indeed, the very building itself is a 12th century fort turned medieval palace! 
The truth is that there's simply so much to see you'll never stand a chance of seeing it in a day, 
so better just to plan out those elements you wish to explore and keep it on your bucket list for another visit.
