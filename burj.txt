The Burj Khalifa is one of the United Arab Emirates most famous buildings and the soaring sky-high landmark of Dubai. 
Not only is it the world's tallest building, but it also lays claim to the titles of tallest freestanding structure in the world, 
highest observation deck in the world and elevator with the longest travel distance in the world. 
A trip up to the observation deck with its panoramic views across Dubai is a sightseeing highlight for most tourists who visit, 
though for those who suffer from vertigo it might be best to give it a miss.
