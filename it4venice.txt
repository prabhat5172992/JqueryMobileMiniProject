Referred to as "The City of Water", Venice is the crown jewel of water cities. 
Romantic gondolas, and Italian architecture along the Grand Canal helped earn this status. 
Stitched together with over 150 canals that have become central to its character, Venice has decayed since its heyday and has more tourists than residents, 
but with its romantic charm it remains one of the top tourist attractions in Italy.
