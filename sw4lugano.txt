The city is located on Lake Lugano, in the Italian speaking section of this alpine country. Lugano, which is blessed with warm summers, dates back to the 9th century. 
The city is home to a large number of Swiss heritage sites, including three cathedrals, two libraries and several museums. 
Home to numerous financial institutions, the city also hosts an annual classical music festival, the Lugano Festival, in the summer.
