The Natural History Museum attracted 5.3 million visitors in 2014, an increase of 1% on the previous year. 
The museum looks after more than 80 million different specimens spanning billions of years. 
Earlier this month, it announced it's creating a "virtual dive" of the Great Barrier Reef, which it says is similar to Google Street View but on the sea floor.
