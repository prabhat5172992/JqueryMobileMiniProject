Los Cabos is a lively 20 mile beach area at the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. 
The white sandy beaches backed by sophisticated resorts, restaurants, bars and other attractions run from 
spring break destination Cabo San Lucas down to the quieter San Jose del Cabo. 
Los Cabos is a great destination for water sport aficionados with some of the best all-around sport fishing in the world. 
In the winter, whales can be observed in the Pacific ocean
