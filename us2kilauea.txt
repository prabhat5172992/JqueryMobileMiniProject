Kilauea is the most recent of a series of volcanoes that have created the Hawaiian Archipelago. 
It is a very low, flat shield volcano, vastly different in profile from the high, sharply sloping peaks of stratovolcanoes. 
Kilauea is one of the most active volcano on the Earth, an invaluable resource for volcanologists. 
Thirty-three eruptions have taken place since 1952, not including the current eruption which started on January 3, 1983 and is still ongoing.
