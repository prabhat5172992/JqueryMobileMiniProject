Located in the Brazilian Highlands, Brasilia was installed in 1960 as Brazil's capital. 
Brazil's former President Juscelino Kubitschek ordered the city to be planned and developed into what some refer to as a utopia. 
Brasilia's modern day infrastructure is designed in the shape of an airplane in which each of its sections serve as different districts such as government, commercial, residential and cultural. 
The city's new and creative designed buildings attracts many architecture aficionados. 
Most significant is the Three Powers Square, which houses the Presidential Palace, the Congress and the Supreme Court. 
Other important buildings include the Brasilia Cathedral with its glass roof that resembles hands reaching up to heaven.
