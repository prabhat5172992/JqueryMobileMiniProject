The city of Oaxaca is well-known for having one of the best Dia de Los Muertos festivals in Mexico, a holiday celebrated in many parts of Latin America. 
In Mexico the festival can be traced back thousands of years ago to indigenous cultures such as the Zapotec and Aztec. 
In Oaxaca the Day of the Dead Festival starts at the end of October when families prepare the tombs for the return of the spirits. 
During this time tombs and home altars are decorated with flowers and families leave offerings for the spirits in the cemeteries.
