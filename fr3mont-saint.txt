If you're looking for a beautiful backdrop then this is hard to beat. 
A medieval town perched atop an imposing rocky outcrop in Normandy, Mont Saint-Michel is one of the top attractions in France and contains, 
amongst other things, a stunning Romanesque Abbey, medieval church and historic battlements. 
Be warned however that the steep climb to Abbey is pretty darn demanding.
