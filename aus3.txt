One of the world's largest monoliths, Ayers Rock is also one of the top tourist attractions in Australia. 
Located within the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park of the Northern Territory, this large sandstone formation stands more than 340 meters (1,100 feet) high. 
One of the rock's peculiarities is that it changes colors dramatically at sunset from terra cotta to blue, violet and red. 
The local Aboriginal tribe, known as Anangu, call the rock Uluru and regard it as a sacred site.
