Though there are several places of tourist-interest in the town and district,
Kanyakumari is especially popular in India for its spectacular and unique sunrise and sunset. 
The confluence of three ocean bodies, the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea, makes the sunrise and sunset even more special. 
On balmy, full-moon evenings, one can also see the moon-rise and sunset at the same time, on either side of the horizon.
