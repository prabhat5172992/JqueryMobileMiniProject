Geneva is a city where international influences reign supreme. 
It is home to the International Red Cross Committee and the European headquarters of the United Nations, as well as 20 other international organizations. 
Environmental travelers will enjoy the fact that Geneva is a "green" city, with 20 percent of its land devoted to parks, 
earning it the nickname of "city of parks". Top sights include the Cathedral of St. Pierre where John Calvin gave famous sermons, and the United Nations headquarters. 
Geneva also is a good city explore by bike or rest weary feet by taking a boat ride on Lake Geneva.
