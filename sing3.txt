The Chinese build temples to a lot of gods and other things, but the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is one of the more unusual.
In the late 1980s when a Buddhist temple was first proposed for Singapore's Chinatown, it was supposed to become a more traditional temple.
Somewhere along the line it became the Tooth Relic Temple, a home for a tooth relic from Buddha. 
The temple, located in central Chinatown, also features other arts and culture of Singaporean Buddhists.
