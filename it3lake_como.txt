Lake Como is part of the Italian Lake District an area popular with visitors for well over 100 years 
for its combination of fresh air, water, mountains and good weather. 
The lake is shaped much like an inverted 'Y', with two branches starting at Como in the south-west and Lecco in the south-east, 
which join together half way up and the lake continues up to Colico in the north. 
The lake is famous for the attractive villas which have been built here since Roman times.
Many have admirable gardens which benefit from the mild climate and are able to include tropical as well as temperate plants.
