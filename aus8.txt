The Great Ocean Road, which is located in Victoria, is considered to be one of the most beautiful drives in Australia. 
This 243 km (151 mile) drive starts in Torquay, which is located about 100 km (60 miles) from Melbourne, and ends in Allansford. 
As it travels along Victoria's beautiful southwest coastline, the Great Ocean Road passes by some of the most stunning scenery in Australia, including 
The Twelve Apostles, which are pretty limestone stack formations that rise out of the ocean near Port Campbell National Park. 
There are also a number of places along the Great Ocean Road where you can spot some of Australia's famous wildlife, including kangaroos, fur seals and emus.
