This beautiful island, which is located in Queensland, boasts rainforests, sand dunes, more than 100 freshwater lakes and pretty colored sand cliffs. 
Fraser Island, which is just a short ferry trip from Hervey Bay, is also considered to be the largest sand island in the world. 
This island boasts another unusual claim to fame, its dingoes are considered to be some of the most pure in all of Australia, 
as they have not had as many chances to crossbreed with dogs as their mainland cousins have had.
