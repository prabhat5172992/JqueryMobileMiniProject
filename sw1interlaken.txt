Interlaken used to be known as a watch making center, but today it's more popular as a tourist resort. 
Tourists started coming to Interlaken in the early 1800s to breathe in the mountain air and partake of spa treatments. 
Its popularity only grew from there. Offering spectacular views of three famous Swiss mountains, 
the Eiger, the Jungfrau and the Monch, the city is also a popular base camp 
for outdoor acitivites in the surrounding Bernese Oberland Alps. 
Travelers looking for something different to do might want to sign up for a class or two at a woodcarving school. 
Hungry tourists may want to try raclette, a classic Swiss dish made from cheese.
